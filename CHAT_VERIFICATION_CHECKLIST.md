- ✅ Memory usage is reasonable
- ✅ No memory leaks over time
```

## Integration Testing

### With vimm-core Authentication
```
Test: End-to-end authentication flow
Steps:
1. Visit watch page (not logged in)
2. Click "Log in" link
3. Complete Hive Keychain auth
4. Return to watch page
Expected:
- ✅ User context updates
- ✅ Chat input becomes enabled
- ✅ Can send messages immediately
- ✅ Username displays correctly
```

### With vimm-chat Server
```
Test: API integration
Steps:
1. Open browser DevTools Network tab
2. Load chat
3. Send a message
Expected:
- ✅ GET /api/chat/messages/:hiveAccount (200 OK)
- ✅ GET /api/chat/config/:hiveAccount (200 OK)
- ✅ Socket.IO connection established
- ✅ POST /api/chat/messages/:hiveAccount (201 Created)
- ✅ Socket.IO emit chat-message
- ✅ Socket.IO receive chat-message
```

## Browser Compatibility

Test in:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

## Configuration Verification

### Environment Variables
Check `src/config/default.js`:
```javascript
chat: {
  server: 'https://vimmcore.webhop.me:4443',  // ✅ Correct URL
  endpoints: { /* ... */ }  // ✅ Defined but not used (using spec URLs)
}
```

### Socket.IO Transports
```javascript
transports: ['websocket', 'polling']  // ✅ Fallback to polling if WS fails
```

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation
1. **No emote support** - Plain text only
2. **No message pagination** - Loads last 50 messages only
3. **No typing indicators** - Users don't see who is typing
4. **No user list** - Can't see who's in chat
5. **No chat commands** - No /ban, /timeout etc. in UI
6. **No chat settings UI** - Owner can't change settings from UI

### Backend Dependent
1. **Cannot test locally** - Requires chat server
2. **Requires authentication** - Needs vimm-core token
3. **CORS must be configured** - Server must allow origin
4. **WebSocket port** - Must be accessible (firewall, etc.)

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Code
- [x] All files committed to git
- [x] No console.log() in production code (kept for debugging)
- [x] No TODO comments for critical features
- [x] Error boundaries in place (React default)

### Configuration
- [ ] Verify chat server URL for production
- [ ] Verify CORS settings on server
- [ ] Verify JWT_SECRET matches vimm-core
- [ ] Verify WebSocket ports are open

### Testing
- [ ] All test scenarios pass
- [ ] Mobile devices tested
- [ ] Multiple browsers tested
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Security review completed

### Documentation
- [x] Implementation summary created
- [x] Code commented adequately
- [x] API integration documented
- [ ] User documentation updated

### Monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking configured (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics events added (optional)
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Socket.IO connection logging

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

1. **Quick fix**: Revert to iframe implementation
   - Undo changes to WatchPage.js
   - Restore iframe code
   - Deploy immediately

2. **Investigate**: 
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Check network tab for failed requests
   - Check Socket.IO connection status
   - Review server logs

3. **Common issues**:
   - CORS errors → Fix server CORS config
   - Connection refused → Check server URL/firewall
   - 401/403 errors → Check JWT token/auth
   - Messages not appearing → Check Socket.IO events

## Success Criteria

Implementation is successful when:
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ Component renders without crashing
- ⏳ Chat loads messages (requires backend)
- ⏳ Messages can be sent (requires backend + auth)
- ⏳ Real-time delivery works (requires backend)
- ⏳ Moderation features work (requires backend + auth)
- ⏳ Mobile responsive design works
- ⏳ Error handling is graceful

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy backend services**
   - Deploy vimm-chat server
   - Deploy vimm-core server
   - Verify both are accessible

2. **Configure production URLs**
   - Update `src/config/default.js` with production URLs
   - Set up environment-specific configs if needed

3. **Test in staging**
   - Run all test scenarios
   - Fix any issues found
   - Verify performance

4. **Deploy to production**
   - Deploy frontend
   - Monitor for errors
   - Verify basic functionality

5. **Enhance features**
   - Add emote support
   - Add chat commands
   - Add settings UI
   - Add user list
   - Improve UX based on feedback
